		Frostflame is more of a unique hero compared to the rest.
		<br>
		Lacking most features from other mugs, such as a handle and some general liquid inside of the mug,
		<br>
		it is unknown how frostflame is currently standing without any sustenance inside of his mug.
		<br>
		<br>
		Frostflame’s flames do not provide the same heat like a normal fire would.
		<br>
		Instead, the flames provide a “chilling” sensation, akin to being sick due to a fever or similar illness.
		<br>
		His flames generally are always active (as depicted from the constant flame on his head),
		<br>
		but can be controlled in any way he deems necessary.
		<br>
		His flames can also solidify whenever he chooses, which turns the flames into ice.
