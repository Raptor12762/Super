		This universe consists of Mug people and Teapot people, where the Mug people are usually considered as “Good Guys” and the Teapot people are considered as “Bad Guys.” All people in this universe have either a Mug for a head or a Teapot for a head, and their body colors vary depending on their goals and or abilities. Not all teapots and mugs are made equally, such as some being purple or some having the ability to create stone spikes from seemingly nowhere.

		Most people in this universe are created with some sort of ceramics, and generally are able to use tools / have joints like how humans do. The two types of people are separated into groups, either being classified as Mugs or Teapots, with no real inbetween. Most people reside in towns of teapots or towns of mugs, with there being “outcast” nations with both mugs and teapots together.
