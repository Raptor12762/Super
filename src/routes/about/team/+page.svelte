        I pushed the files incorperating Svelte and Tailwind. I worked a lot with the drawer and put the images on the front page. I also managed the Github page.

        Being the main developer for this website and project. I constructed most of the layout that you see within the site.
        I mainly worked on the layout for the character, team, home, about pages, and the contact form.
        I also assisted in the design during the wireframing portion and made the flowchart showing the navigation of the site.
