        I pushed the files incorperating Svelte and Tailwind. I worked a lot with the drawer and put the images on the front page. I also managed the Github page.

        Being the main developer for this website and project. I constructed most of the layout that you see within the site.
        I mainly worked on the layout for the character, team, home, about pages, and the contact form.
        I also assisted in the design during the wireframing portion and made the flowchart showing the navigation of the site.

        I was the one to do all of the site animations, art, and gennerally all of the design stuff for the webstie!! Most of the stuff was 
        based on my own OCs, so it was relatively simple to try and port over most of the stuff here.
